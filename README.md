👋 Hi, I’m @Saadtamari

As a Data Science and AI enthusiast at YU, I'm deeply engrossed in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. My forte lies in Python, with a solid grasp of C++. 💻🧠

I've penned a short book on OOP, resonating with many students. This journey started post my eight-month stint teaching Python and OOP, along with data science lectures. 📚👨‍🏫

My vision? "Science is for everyone, and the charity of science is its dissemination." I'm passionate about learning and teaching. I'm drawn to business, finance, and tech, with dreams of becoming a founder. 🌐💼

I'm a driven individual, always aiming for progress and development. I'm deeply invested in my field, with a focus on machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and teaching others. 🎯👩‍🏫

I lead with confidence, having led teams in various locations. My teamwork skills are commendable, honed through numerous volunteering experiences. Volunteering is my way of contributing positively to society. 🌱🤝

I thrive on leadership and entrepreneurship. I've actively participated in leadership and innovation competitions, achieving significant success at the national level in Jordan. I'm confident that one day, I'll emerge as one of the world's leading✨️🚀 entrepreneurs.
